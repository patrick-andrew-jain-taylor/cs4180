Written Problems:

Problem #1:

1) Alice can be sure she is talking to Bob because she initiates the
connection with a nonce and not something sensitive like a key, can verify
Bob's identify by using K_AB to decrypt Bob's message and verify the nonce she
sent as well as match the timestamp to her clock.

2) Bob an be sure he is talking to Alice since in addition to his nonce, only the
encrypted Alice nonce and time stamp are included in his message. the included
time stamp verifies that a malicious attacker would be unable to martch r_A to
E_K_AB (r_A), which would allow an attacker to match plaintext to ciphertext.
The message from Alice verfies that Alice is trustworthy, since only Alice
could know K_AB on her own and not from Bob's message.

Problem #2:

Bob is not assured his is talking to Alice. Bob's message contains both R and
an encrypted version of R using his own key; a potential attacker would only
have to match a decrypted version of R to guess his key, and without a
timestamp it is impossible for Bob to know hwo long a response would take (not
to mention, him being stateless prevents Bob from remembering what time he
sent his response). Since Alice's response contains two different encrypted
versions of R (K_B, K_AB) without R itself, therefore Bob has no way of
verifying a correct response from Alice since R is forgotten.

A modified version of the protocol is as follows:

(1) Alice ---"I'm Alice"---------------------> Bob
(2) Alice <--E_K_AB("Prove it", timestamp)---- Bob
(3) Alice ---E_K_AB("I'm Alice", timestamp)--> Bob

The modified 2 steps in this protocol prevent a malicious host from
determining preshare keys from a plaintext and ciphertext pair as well as
verifying the host has the right shared key without requiring Bob to keep
track of a nonce.

Normal command: nmap -O ottawa.clic.cs.columbia.edu
Issue: running on clic machine requires root (students not granted root)
Solution: run on Windows 7 machine
