This folder will contain all entries for Homework 0, an ungrades test of knowledge on socketing: set up a simple server/client scenario. In this scenario, server and clients exchange simple messages using sockets.

In my implementation, this will involve first setting up a server to listen to connections at an unspecified port. This will be done in a way to allow the user who wants to connect to the server at any port they specify (excluding 0-1024). Once a connection is established, the server waits for input from the user, and responds with an acknowledgment that that message was received (with the accompanying message).

This will likely involve multithreading, with a parent thread for listening and child threads for replying to each client in the order messages were received (requiring a queue).

Once the server is initialized, it waits a specified amount of time before timing out and closing the socket without receiving a connection (~30 minutes). Once the client makes a connection, it waits a specified amount of time before timing out and closing its socket without receiving user input (~5 minutes).
